This repo contains the solutions to HackerRank problems listed in the assignment.

The solutions are listed sequentially in the `scripts.py` file, from top to bottom (first all HackerRank's problems included in Problem 1, then Problem 2). 

Each subset of problems is introduced by a `### <CategoryName>` comment (e.g. `### Introduction`) to separate them more clearly. Unindented single-line comments starting with a `#` mark the start of an HackerRank problem. Other comments are either in string format (i.e. `"""some comment"""`) or inline after a line of code (i.e. `some_function() #  explanation in comment`), unless the comment is included in the problem's skeleton and cannot be edited (for example, in the case of `#!/bin/python3` directives).

The `stamps/` directory contains a single PDF file, listing the submissions' printouts in reverse cronological order.
